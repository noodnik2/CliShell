RE:     Data structures to support commands for CLI

Terminology:

Command:                java method
- i.e., "void myMethod(String arg)"

Full Command Name:      vector of one or more tokens used as "primary key" to locate a Command
- i.e., "my method" => "void myMethod"

Partial Command Name:   vector of one or more partial tokens used to locate one or more Full Command Names
- i.e., "m me" => "my method"

What we'd like is a class to manage full and partial command names; some methods;

void addFullCommand(Full Command Name)
- this method would add the full command name to its database

Set<Full Command Name> getFullCommands(Partial Command Name)
- this method would return a set of zero or more Full Command Names corresponding to the given Partial Command Name supplied
